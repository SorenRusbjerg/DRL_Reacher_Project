# Tried methods
* Batch normlayers
* Changing random seed for network
* only updating agent after N steps 
* High process noise
* Low process noise
* Gradient clipping
* reducing exploration, decreasing process noise
* Training many episodes
* Fixed random noise to gausian
* Setting high time steps = 1000


# New tests
* Multi agents env
* Changing Network size to bigger / smaller
* Changing Learning rates

# Missing functions
* saving network weights 
* loading weights
